# Corona

In this project we just tried to predict the Corona cases on the basis of previous month measuremsnts of cases.

 step 1 : For doing so we have taken the dataset of the cases and casualities of the month of June.

 step 2 : Then we have performed the Time Series Forecasting using RNN.

 step 3 :Then we would be able to predict the measurements for the next month (July).
